# Verification record

Development host: Windows x86-64, Python 3.12.10. Physical macOS machine unavailable.
Milestone commits are individually recoverable in Git history.

## M1 — P2P core

Implemented certificate identities and persisted pins, mutual TLS, bounded v1
messages, receiver consent, streaming, SHA-256, collision-safe finalization and
disconnect errors. Core files: `core/{storage,identity,protocol}.py`,
`network/transfer.py`, `tests/{conftest,test_core}.py` and project documentation.

Validation: `python -m pytest -q` — **8 passed**. Actual loopback TLS tests with
independent configurations cover accepted/declined/empty/Unicode/multiple files,
16 MiB streaming, collisions, offline recipients and identity persistence.

Limitations at this checkpoint: test-provisioned trust only; no GUI, native
integration or user pairing yet. Next: desktop UI and discovery.
